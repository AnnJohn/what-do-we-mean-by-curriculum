## What Do We Mean By Curriculum? 

Every individual piece of curriculum is called a Lesson. 

A **Lesson** can be either a Readme or a Lab. Each lesson is stored in its own repository on Github. 

A **Readme** is expository material that describes one or more concepts. Readmes can include exercises for the student to practice, but they’re optional and we’re not testing to see whether the student has successfully passed it.

A **Lab** is more complicated and a student cannot advance to the next lesson unless she has successfully completed and submitted a lab. All of our coding challenges are test driven so you must create tests that a student’s solution needs to pass. The file structure of a lab will vary depending on the type of lab and the topic you’re teaching.

## How Lessons are Organized

Lessons can be organized into **Units**. While a unit can vary in length, at a minimum, they should contain at least two pieces of content (a Readme and a Lab). 

A series of units can be combined to form a **Topic**. 

One or more connected Topics create a **Track**.
